It depends on how you plan to use it. If you are using it to refer to GitHub, such as a link to GitHub that says \"Check me out on :octocat:,\" that is perfectly fine. However, if you're using the octocat to refer to a product that is not GitHub, then that is not considered fair use. This goes for all usage situations including but not limited to applications, print material, and websites.</p>            <h3><span>Q:</span> Can I use an octocat as my app logo or icon?</h3>      <p>Since the Octocat is a registered trademark of GitHub, using an Octocat as your logo or icon is not allowed.</p>            <h3><span>Q:</span> Can I use an octocat as my avatar?</h3>      <p>You can use an octocat as your personal avatar, but not for your company or a product you're building. You are welcome to show your <3 for GitHub, but not appear as if you == GitHub.</p>            <h3><span>Q:</span> Can I make my own octocat?</h3>      <p>So long as it is created for personal/fan use, you are more than welcome to create and display your own octocat. If you choose to distribute your octocat, you <strong>may not</strong> do so with a license, Creative Commons or otherwise, that allows modification or distribution of the octocat.</p>            <h3><span>Q:</span> Can I submit an octocat to the Octodex?</h3>      <p>We make quite a few octocats here at GitHub. Since they probably wouldn't be seen by more than a few people internally, we created the Octodex as a way to show them to the world. Everything on this list is official GitHub artwork and is under GitHub's trademark license, so we only include submissions from people affiliated with GitHub.</p>            <h3><span>Q:</span> Can I create a product containing an octocat?</h3>      <p>You may not use an octocat, created by GitHub or by you, for products or merchandise without written permission from GitHub. This includes, but is not limited to t-shirts, toys, stickers, etc.</p>            <h3><span>Q:</span> Do all the octocats have a purpose?</h3>      <p>Not all of them. The original list was comprised entirely of octocats that were used for legitimate purposes, but over time the list began to fill up with nonsense. By the time <a href=\"/nyantocat\">memes</a> started to make their way onto the list, we knew it was hopeless to try to keep them all practical.</p>                  <h2>Legal speak:</h2>      <p>GITHUB&reg;, the GITHUB&reg; logo design, OCTOCAT&reg; and the OCTOCAT&reg; logo design are exclusive trademarks registered in the United States by GitHub, Inc.
